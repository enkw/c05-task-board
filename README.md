# c05-task-board


## Description

The goal of this was to fix the code provided so that the kanban board allows you to add a task by entering the task name, description, and due date. Once the task is added, the user is able to drag
the task where they desire on the board, and delete said task once it's no longer needed. The tasks will change color as well based off of their due dates (Yellow for due that day, red for past due).

I learned a lot about bootstrap and jQuery while working on this project, and feel like after this, though I might not fully understand all concepts I'm working with, I've gained a better understanding
overall and have learned how to research and troubleshoot the issues I have with these better.
